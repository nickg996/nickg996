 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nickg996
 I'm a Computer Science student at Irvine Valley College and am currently teaching myself how to code! 
 Iâ€™m learning JavaScript at the moment but have a solid foundation in the following: C/C++, Java, XML, Python, HTML/CSS
 Iâ€™m posting this work to catalogue the projects I make as I go through school.
